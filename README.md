# The EVA's explorer

Here you can find a work-in-progress data science project on Extra-vehicular Activity from a NASA dataset
source: https://data.nasa.gov/Raw-Data/Extra-vehicular-Activity-EVA-US-and-Russia/9kcy-zwvn

I started this project during the Open Source Saturday in Turin, and as the data set needed to be prepared for the exploration,  someone suggested me to create a separated script so other people could just play with the clean data set. 
You can find as **eva-dataset_cleaner.py**
I really thank you the group for the support and help.

*Both the cleaner and the exploration are work-in-progress, I'll keep the description in here updated.*

## Further info

EVAs are activities done by an astronaut or cosmonaut outside a spacecraft beyond the Earth's appreciable atmosphere.
